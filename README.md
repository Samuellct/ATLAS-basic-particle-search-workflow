# ATLAS-basic-particle-search-workflow

This project focused on searching for a hypothetical particle X in simulated collider data. The goal was to try to implement some particle-physics data-analysis techniques: applying selection cuts, reducing background, and performing basic statistical studies to evaluate whether a signal could be observed.


The Python analysis scripts are derived from a reference implementation provided by Dr. Louie Corpe, my professor for the course. The version provided here is the one used for the final plots and includes parameter adjustments I made to analyse the specific simulated dataset assigned to my group (each group had a different dataset, some containing particle X, others not).


The dataset itself is not included here. It consisted of 10,000 event Monte-Carlo samples, designed to mimic LHC-like proton–proton collisions as could be recorded by the ATLAS experiment.
